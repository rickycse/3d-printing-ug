  HOME: `Welcome to my unofficial guide to 3D printing! I recently got my own 3D printer and thought I'd write about my experience so far, along with a short guide for the newcomers.`,

  DISCLAIMER: `I am NOT an expert in 3D printing, nor am I an industrial or occupational hygienist. This guide is based on my own experiences and research, and I am NOT responsible for any injury or damage that may occur from following it. Please do your own research and take proper safety precautions when working with 3D printers and related equipment.`,

  FINALE: `You've got your printer, got your filaments, and setup your enclosure. You're finally ready to get into the fun part, printing (and maybe modeling)! Honestly, I don't have much of an opinion or guide here, use whatever software works for you! Personally, I've been using Fusion360 to model everything, but I've heard that onShape is a good alternative as well.`,

  SCIENCE: {
    WIP: `I wanted to add a section to talk about the science behind 3d printing and some of the health concerns if you aren't careful. I haven't done enough research yet, but once I do, I plan on returning this section. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to let me know!`
